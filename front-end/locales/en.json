    "faq-desc":"We answered frequently asked questions below.",
    "q1":"Q1: How do you use all these labeled data?",
    "a1":"We will use the data to train an AI model for recognizing smoke emissions based on <a href='https://github.com/CMU-CREATE-Lab/deep-smoke-machine' target='_blank'>our previous work</a>. The model will be a deep neural network that can learn how to classify videos into two categories: having smoke or no smoke.Then, we will use the model to recognize smoke for many dates and camera views on <a href='https://spotdegifwolk.nl/' target='_blank'>Frisse Wind's camera</a>.",
    "q2":"Q2: Why do you need help from volunteers?",
    "a2":"While deep neural networks have been proven useful in various applications (e.g., object recognition), training such networks requires a considerable amount of labeled data. Annotating all the data will take hundreds of hours for one researcher, which is why we need help from volunteers.",
    "q3":"Q3: Why is it important to recognize and visualize smoke emissions?",
    "a3":"Our <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03293.pdf' target='_blank'>previous work in air quality monitoring</a> shows that visualizing evidence of smoke emissions can influence the attitude of regulators. Also, using such visual data increased the community's confidence when addressing air pollution.",
    "q4":"Q4: Where do these video clips come from?",
    "a4":"We selected and cropped several windows into videos from the <a href='https://www.youtube.com/@frissewindnu' target='_blank'>Frisse Wind's YouTube channel</a>. The original camera footage is on <a href='https://spotdegifwolk.nl/' target='_blank'>Frisse Wind's tool</a>.",
    "q5":"Q5: Why did my labels not pass the quality check? How did you define the quality?",
    "a5":"For each batch (16 videos) on the page, the system randomly placed several videos with known answers, also called gold standards. A batch will pass the quality check if you label these gold standards correctly.",
    "q6":"Q6: How does the system know if smoke emission is present in a video?",
    "a6":"The system defines the final label by aggregating answers from citizens and researchers. At least two volunteers or one researcher will review each video. If the answers from the two volunteers agree, the system marks the video according to the agreement. Otherwise, another volunteer or researcher will review the video, and the result is aggregated based on majority voting.",
    "q7":"Q7: Why sometimes does a dialog box pop up and ask me to enable video autoplay?",
    "a7":"During labeling, videos need to play automatically. If a mobile device has data saver enabled, videos will stop autoplay. Also, some mobile devices pause videos after waking up from sleeping mode. To enable autoplay, browsers require user interactions, which is why the system shows the dialog box.",
    "q8":"Q8: Why do I sometimes see similar videos? Were they the same?",
    "a8":"Videos that have closer times (e.g., 8 and 8:10 am) can look similar due to the same weather and lighting conditions. Also, gold standard videos for the quality check can appear again if you label many batches.",
    "q9":"Q9: Can I build a similar system with your code?",
    "a9":"This project is <a href='https://github.com/MultiX-Amsterdam/ijmond-camera-monitor' target='_blank'>open-sourced on GitHub</a>. Please feel free to reuse the code.",
    "q10":"Q10: Are there other actions that I can take to advocate for better air quality?",
    "a10":"We recommend checking <a href='https://www.frissewind.nu/' target='_blank'>Frisse Wind's website</a> to understand opportunities for air quality advocacy, the <a href='https://odnzkg.nl/faq-handhaving-tata-steel-kooksgasfabrieken/' target='_blank'>environmental services's action</a> in addressing the air pollution concerns, the <a href='https://hollandse-luchten.org/' target='_blank'>Hollandse Luchten network</a> to understand local citizen science activities in monitoring air quality, the <a href='https://www.rivm.nl/nieuws/directe-relatie-tussen-uitstoot-tata-steel-en-hinder-en-kans-op-ziekte' target='_blank'>recent RIVM report</a> about the health impact of Tata Steel emissions, and <a href='https://www.ad.nl/binnenland/harde-conclusie-onderzoek-tata-inwoners-wijk-aan-zee-leven-korter-door-uitstoot-staalfabriek~a9bbf8f4/'>this news article</a> about how various stakeholders respond to RIVM's research results.",
    "q11":"Q11: Why does this tool not support devices older than Android 7 and iOS 11?",
    "a11":"When labeling smoke, this tool shows 16 videos at the same time. Older devices have difficulties in playing these videos, which results in poor user experiences.",
    "q12":"Q12: Why are there no nighttime videos to label?",
    "a12":"Smoke emissions in nighttime videos (captured by commercial digital cameras) are tough for the computer to recognize due to insufficient light. We want to focus on training the computer to recognize daytime smoke emissions first.",

    "scenario-intro3": "We have <span class='custom-text-info-dark-theme'>10 people</span> below that visited a doctor. The doctor will have to examine them and give a diagnosis",
    "scenario-intro4": "In a similar fashion, our model will examine the videos and depending on how well it is trained it will predict which of those videos contain smoke; so the same idea and metrics stand",
    "scenario-intro5": "The people with <span class='red-text'>this color</span> are the ones that are actually sick",
    "scenario-intro6": "We can see from the <span class='red-text'>sick patients (1st row)</span> the doctor has diagnosed <span class='green-text'>three</span> succesfully and misdiagnosed <span class='purple-text'>one</span> as healthy. From the <span class='custom-text-info-dark-theme'>healthy patients (2nd row)</span> they diagnosed <span class='green-text'>four</span> healthy patients succesfully and misdiagnosed <span class='purple-text'>two</span> as unhealthy",
